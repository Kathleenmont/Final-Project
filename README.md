# First Taste

This is a React app for the food adventurous. Find and track food dishes you would like to try from all over the world. 

## How it Works

Click on a continent dot to get started. Then click on a country to see some dishes. Find dishes that you want to try and add them to your list by clicking ADD, click FIND to see restaurants that may serve that dish in your area (as of now only serving the Philly area). 

See your list by clicking MY LIST. After you try a dish on your list hit the TRIED button to give a rating to help you track how much you enjoyed it. To see the dishes you have tried and rated go to the TRIED tab on the nav bar.
